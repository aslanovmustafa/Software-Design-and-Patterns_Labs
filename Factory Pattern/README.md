You are about to write an application for your friend who is planning
to explode ice-cream market with his new ice-cream making approach.


• There are several interesting facts he decided to share with you with
respect to his magical approach


• “To make a good ice-cream…” he says, you need to:


o Pour the milk, heavy cream, vanilla and sugar to a blender


o Blend until smooth


o Add chunky chocolate extras


o Freeze the mixture


o Decorate your ice-cream


o Put in a nice cup


• Your friend plans to keep things simple for the beginning and claims
that he would like to serve only few ice-cream types, namely “Rocky
Road”, “Peanut Cream”, “Cookie Dough” and “Cherry Blossom”


• And yes, he is planning to franchise his ice-cream model across the
country…if he succeeds of course…


• Go ahead and assist your friend to fulfill his dream by the help of the
Factory Pattern. Consider all the concepts that we have discussed
during the last lecture and try to apply them to this exercise.
