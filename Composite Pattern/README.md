• Imagine that you are helping to design a banking application


• Customers in your banking application might have different accounts,
such like Deposit and Savings


• We are asked to prepare a design which can be useful to show
customer’s total account balance after merging all the account
statements.


• You have to have four basic methods in your Component class, which
are getBalance(), add(), remove() and getChild()


• Think about your Composite and Leaf classes


• In your Client, create several types of accounts with balance on them
and then call getBalance() method to return total customer balance


• Comment out your usage of the composite pattern classes and explain
your motivation behind that use.
