Object Oriented Program that has an abstract class Student and 2 interfaces TakesTrain and SportClass. 
To simulate, StudentSimulation should be run.

lab tasks are below for more clear understanding:

Lab1 – Strategy Pattern

• Imagine that we have different types of students (elementary school
students, middle school students, and high school students).

• Every student can get from his/her house to a school via certain public
transport depending on his/her class level. Elementary school students
can only take bus, for a middle school student it is allowable to take train
and a high school student can even use taxi.

• Students are allowed to take different sport classes in their school, yet
strict rules are applied across all schools with respect to student’s school
type. Elementary school students are not allowed to take any sport class.
Middle school students can take no more than 2, and high school
students can take no more than 4 sport classes per year.

• Keep in mind that students grow (e.g. from elementary school to middle
school), and then your code should consider this dynamic behavior using
appropriate code logic.

• You can imagine any kind of variables and methods for your classes, yet
they should make senses within the discussion domain, and please use
meaningful variable and method names.

• Define changeable and unchangeable behavior based on the text and
your own imagination (be explicit with your assumptions).
