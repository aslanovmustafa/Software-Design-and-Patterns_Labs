• Your task in this lab is to utilize the power of the iterator pattern and
create a common ground for the iteration through different data
structures:


o Imagine a hotel management system that has been
implemented by three different vendors and stores Room Item


o Vendors used various Java collections – HashMap, Tree and List


o Your job is to help to the Client code to iterate through these
collections and at least implement printRoomListing() method


o To do that, you have to design your iterators to traverse through
all the defined collections (considering the underlying
implementation details of different collections)


o You SHOULD NOT use Java Iterator; every class should be
defined by you.


• Comment out your usage of the iterator pattern classes and explain
your motivation behind that use
