Today you have to deal with the software to build houses.


• Apply your knowledge of the Template pattern and try to tackle
several issues, such like:


o Think of a base and child classes in your final source code, and
what kind of methods will be used in each


o Keep in mind that the company that hired you have a very clear
step-by-step strategy of how to build fancy and inexpensive
houses


o And do not forget that they use different material during the
construction period (wood, stone, steal and etc.).


• Do not forget to add a hook method to your base class so that child
classes may hook themselves into the algorithm of the base class (if
necessary)


• Comment out your usage of the template pattern classes and explain
your motivation behind that use.
