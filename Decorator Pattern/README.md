You are about to implement small software to handle the Pizza Shop using the decorator pattern (think why).


• You learned that the Pizza Shop is famous for its several pizza types,
such like Bagel pizza, Neapolitan pizza and Maltese pizza.


• Keep in mind that the Pizza Shop is also famous for its pizza toppings,
such like White Goat Cheese, Marinated Beef, Roma Tomatoes, and
wonderful Red Onions.


• Think how to apply the decorator pattern to this case and provide
clean Java code for that.


• If you are done with the Pizza Shop, take a step back and analyze Java
InputStream class that we have discussed during the last lecture. Can
you come up with some useful stream reader, such like
LowerCaseInputStream? Show us some creativity and your final code!
